want:
an added option to change model and size of model/area after X chops/digs
an option to add a sound effect when that happens.

why would you want this thahat/wouter? 
so trees can get a felled-model (down on the ground) while hearthligns would keep chopping. (to keep it user friendly, unlike that modd that added tree stumps)
